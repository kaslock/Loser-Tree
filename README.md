# Loser-Tree

Let's say that a matrix with an integer value as an element was given stored in a two-dimensional array. Use the binary search tree to count the frequency of the integer value for each row of the matrix, and use the laser tree to create a program that sorts the integer values from the highest to the lowest overall matrix in order of descending order.
